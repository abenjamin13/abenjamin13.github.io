    <h1> History of Chapman AEΠ </h1>
		    		<div class="blurb">
              <p>The Alpha Omega Chapter of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity at
                Chapman University was established in the Fall semester of 2011
                as a nationally recognized colony. After 6 semesters as a
                registered Chapman University interest group, Alpha Epsilon Pi
                of Chapman University has gained official status as a member of
                the Inter Fraternity Council at Chapman University.
                <br><br>
                We are looking forward to the coming semester and all our new
                opportunities.

          <div class = test>

            <p>One of Chapman University's biggest student communities.
              Chapman's Greek Life makes up close to 34% of Chapman
              undergraduate students. Chapters complete thousands of hours of
              community service per year and donate thousands of dollars to
              philanthropic organizations, all while building great connections
               that will last a lifetime.
               <br><br>
               Close friends, networking, philanthropic activities, social
               experiences, and everlasting memories are some of the countless
               reasons to join a Greek organization like Alpha Epsilon Pi.

								          <br>

				                  Joining Alpha Epsilon Pi, or any Fraternity, can and will most likely be a life changing event. It’s very difficult to explain the fraternity experience completely.  Each Brother’s experiences are unique.  Included below are several direct quotes from Undergraduate Brothers and Alumni on their fraternity experiences.
													<p></p>
				  “To live a healthy lifestyle, an individual must find balance between his life and everything else in the world. The Fraternity helps me achieve this. I will be forever in debt to my Fraternity and the Brothers of the chapter, and that’s something that you can’t put a price on. I’ve had a lot of friends in my lifetime, but my fraternity brothers stand out from all of my friends, and that is something that I’m very proud of as an Alpha Epsilon Pi brother.” <br>
				  <strong>—Yury Starostin, Beta Delta Chapter, DePaul University</strong> <br><br>


				“During my freshman year I learned that college was great, but AEPi made it amazing. All within one organization, I have made friends of a lifetime, networked with other people in the business world and made an impact on my community. AEPi has driven me to be a better student, and I drive AEPi to be the best it can be, so that others can take away from it what I am right now.”
				<strong>—Josh Fanaroff, Delta Deuteron Chapter, University of Maryland – College Park
