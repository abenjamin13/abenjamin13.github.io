    <h1> History of Chapman AEΠ </h1>
		    		<div class="blurb">
              <p>The Alpha Omega Chapter of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity at
                Chapman University was established in the Fall semester of 2011
                as a nationally recognized colony. After 6 semesters as a
                registered Chapman University interest group, Alpha Epsilon Pi
                of Chapman University has gained official status as a member of
                the Inter Fraternity Council at Chapman University.
                <br><br>
                We are looking forward to the coming semester and all our new
                opportunities.
              </p>

          <center><h1> Why Greek Life </h1></center>
          <div class = test>

            <p>One of Chapman University's biggest student communities.
              Chapman's Greek Life makes up close to 34% of Chapman
              undergraduate students. Chapters complete thousands of hours of
              community service per year and donate thousands of dollars to
              philanthropic organizations, all while building great connections
               that will last a lifetime.
               <br><br>
               Close friends, networking, philanthropic activities, social
               experiences, and everlasting memories are some of the countless
               reasons to join a Greek organization like Alpha Epsilon Pi.
